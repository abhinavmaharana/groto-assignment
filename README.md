### Objective:

Your task is to implement a pixel-perfect frontend design for a property listing interface based on the provided Figma file. The interface includes various features such as sorting options, filters, and dynamic content loading.

### Requirements:

1. Pixel Perfect Design:

- Implement the UI design exactly as provided in the Figma file, ensuring accuracy in layout, styling, and spacing.

2. Sorting Functionality:

- Implement sorting functionality for the property listings based on Price (Low to High, High to Low), Ratings, and Alphabetical order.

3. Filters:

- Incorporate filter options for price range using a draggable slider and ratings filter.

4. Filter Application:

- Upon selecting filter options, a Call to Action (CTA) button should appear to apply the chosen filters.
- After applying the filters, display a skeleton loader to indicate loading, followed by the updated property listings based on the selected filters.

5. Dynamic Data Handling:

- Ensure that the property listing cards are generated dynamically and not hard-coded. Data for the property listings should be fetched and displayed dynamically.
